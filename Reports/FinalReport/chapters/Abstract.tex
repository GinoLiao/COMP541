In  a normal internet environment, the centralized Certificate Authority helps users authenticate each other. However, in an internet-of-things environment, this centralized authority does not exist. Prior work has investigated using gestures as a biometric to authenticate users, but few works perform a security analysis of a gesture-based mechanism when the prover and verifier are two different, asymmetric devices with different types of sensors. In this paper, we study two security models that use dynamic time warping for gesture recognition: (1) when a pre-calibrated gesture library is available, and the prover must authenticate on a different device than calibrated; and (2) authentication via observing a gesture simultaneously. Our experiments with a smartwatch and mobile devices show that model 1 can achieve an false positive and false negative equilibrium of around 10\%-15\%, and the distance of an attacker is always larger than the distance of the verifier.
