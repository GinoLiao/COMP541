\subsection{Other Biometric Recognition Authentication Techniques}

Besides motion and gesture, various biometric characteristics could also be used for recognition as Jain et al. \cite{Jain} specified. These characteristics include: DNA, ear, face, facial thermogram, hand thermogram, hand vein, fingerprint, gait, hand geometry, iris, palmprint, retina, signature, and voice. In some applications, biometric traits are further exploited for machine-to-machine recognition authentication instead of conventional personal recognition.

One example of this idea is an authentication scheme based on heartbeat data (ECG) proposed by Rostami et al.\cite{Rostami:2013}. It requires that the controller of implantable medical devices (IMDs) contacts the patient's body to control the IMD. Specifically, the controller can only gain access to IMDs if the ECG readings on the both devices are approximately the same.  
 
Furthermore, a patent \cite{Apple:2014} submitted by Apple Inc. depicts a more general authentication scheme using biometric data for wireless pairing and communication between devices. The scheme is simply based on the comparison of biometric data which received and stored by the device or the host. Thus, it is applicable with any sort of distinctive biometric traits for machine-to-machine authentication once they embed related module targeting to any specific trait on their commercial devices.
