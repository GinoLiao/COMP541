\label{sec:Progress}

\subsection{Current Accomplishments}

\begin{itemize}
\item Successfully extracted accelerometer data from all three mobile devices
\item Basic gesture functionality of uWave converted to MATLAB programming environment.
\item Initial distance measurements between non-malicious and malicious provers for gesture recognition on a signle device.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Milestones}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{April 6:} Gino extracts Android accelerometer data to computer. Henry sends iPhone accelerometer data to computer. Joe will integrate Wiimote with uWave.  
\item \emph{April 13:} All devices communicate with same computer. Cross-device gesture recognition comparisons with the same user (false negatives)
\item \emph{April 22:} Attacks (cross-device gesture recognition with different users, false positives). Project completed. 
\item \emph{Final Exam Period:} Final project presentation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generalized Division of Labor}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Joe:} Lead for MATLAB software development and wiimote integration.
\item \emph{Zilong:} Lead for Android software development. 
\item \emph{Heng-Yi:} Lead for iOS software development. 
\end{itemize}
