\subsection{Gesture \& Motion Recognition on a Single Device}


For the best user experience, gesture recognition should be in real-time and easy to use. Instead of using a button to indicate start time and end time of a gesture motion, Zoltan \cite{Zoltan} proposes an automatic segmentation method and uses two classification algorithms: Hidden Markov Models(HMM) and Support Vector Machine to to give high accuracy. This system has great performance and low response time, thus a good model for \gls{IoT} devices.
