\subsection{Existing Tooling \& Research Platform}
\label{sec:Tooling}

We aim to use uWave \cite{Liu:2009, LiuuWave}, an algorithm developed at Rice, for gesture recognition during our security analysis. This algorithm is simple and efficient that even simple 16-bit microcontroller can do the computation. 

To test asymmetric pairing between different devices, we plan to use an android smartphone, an iPhone, and also another device with an accelerometer (the details of this \gls{IoT} style device is to be determined after discussion with people from uWave team). Ideally, we will test pairing across each of these 3 devices with a smartphone app.
